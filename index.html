            Our Bloomsbury based practice has been working in central London
            since 2006. Having worked within the oldest areas of London, we have
            developed an expertise in historic buildings. These are often Listed
            and situated within a Conservation Area. Our knowledge and
            experience consistently secure Planning Consents, Listed Building
            Consents and Great Estate Licenses.
          </p>

          <p>
            Many areas within central London boroughs were originally developed
            by aristocratic families (examples being Grosvenor, Cadogan, De
            Walden, Portman and Bedford), and these family estates still own
            large swathes of, what is now commonly referred to as, Prime Central
            London. These Great Estates maintain significant influence either
            through direct ownership or through various stewardship schemes, an
            example being the Belgrave Estate Management Scheme administered by
            Grosvenor. Schemes such as this enable the Estate to exert control
            over the use, development, and appearance of the designated area.
          </p>

          <p>
            We have a growing body of new-build work in Prime Central London and
            elsewhere the UK. The scrutiny exerted by the planning régime in the
            Prime Central London boroughs of The Royal Borough of Kensington and
            Chelsea, the City of Westminster and the London Borough of Camden is
            strict, particularly with regard to new-build developments where
            changes to Conservation Areas must be proven to ‘preserve or
            enhance’ the character of the environment if they are to have any
            chance of obtaining permission. Through sensitive, contextual design
            and iterative dialogue with Clients and Planners, Rodić Davidson
            have established a track record of obtaining difficult planning
            consents for new-build properties.
